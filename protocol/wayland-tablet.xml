    <description summary="drawing tablet device">
      The wl_tablet interface represents one or more drawing tablet devices.

      The wl_tablet interface generates axis events, enter, and leave events for
      the surfaces that the tool is held over and button events for the buttons
      on a tablet tool.

      Since the ability to differentiate between which tablet is sending any
      particular event, each tablet has it's own id. The id ranges from 0 to 49,
      allowing for a total of 50 tablets to be connected at the same time. IDs
      are aggresively recycled, so it is always guaranteed that the ID of the
      next tablet will never be greater then the number of tablets currently
      connected.

	the surface is NULL, the pointer image is hidden completely.

	The parameters hotspot_x and hotspot_y define the position of the
	pointer surface relative to the pointer location. Its top-left corner
	is always at (x, y) - (hotspot_x, hotspot_y), where (x, y) are the
	coordinates of the pointer location, in surface local coordinates.

	On surface.attach requests to the pointer surface, hotspot_x and
	hotspot_y are decremented by the x and y parameters passed to the
	request. Attach must be confirmed by wl_surface.commit as usual.

	The hotspot can also be updated by passing the currently set pointer
	surface to this request with new values for hotspot_x and hotspot_y.

	The current and pending input regions of the wl_surface are cleared,
	and wl_surface.set_input_region is ignored until the wl_surface is no
	longer used as the cursor. When the use as a cursor ends, the current
	and pending input regions become undefined, and the wl_surface is
	unmapped.
